# CryptoFusion

CryptoFusion is a Python implementation of a hybrid encryption and decryption system using both AES and RSA algorithms. This provides a secure and efficient way to protect your sensitive data.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combining the strengths of AES and RSA for a robust encryption scheme.
- **Key Management**: Securely manage keys for both AES and RSA encryption.
- **File Operations**: Encrypt and decrypt files with ease.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `cryptography`

## Usage

1. **Generate Keys**: Use OpenSSL to generate AES and RSA keys.

```bash
# AES Key
openssl rand -hex 32 > aes-key.txt

# RSA Keys
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

2. **Encrypt a Message/File**:

```bash
python encrypt.py
```

3. **Decrypt a Message/File**:

```bash
python decrypt.py
```

## File Structure

- `encrypt.py`: Script for encrypting a message or file.
- `decrypt.py`: Script for decrypting a message or file.
- `aes-key.txt`: Store your AES key here.
- `private_key.pem`: Your RSA private key.
- `public_key.pem`: Your RSA public key.
